## Past Projects

### _Begonia_ unknown sp./hybrid study - AS 
Morphological and genetic study of an unknown _Begonia_ specimen, and comparison with two known species. It implied measurements (morphology, pollen count...), sequencing of nuclear and chloroplastic loci, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction (sequences of these three _Begonia_ and closely related species from Genbank).

### Educational boards for Palms garden - QSBG _unfinished_
Creation of educative boards for QSBG Palms Garden with information relative to palm distribution, diversity, uses as well as interesting trivia. Done with _Adobe InDesign_ and _Adobe Illustrator_.

### Succulent plant book of QSBG - QSBG
Staff may mistake species from the succulent greenhouses or nursery, hence the production of an illustrated book of the succulent collection. I created this book based on previous and new identifications (wrong or missing labels in some case). The book contains a brief introduction of the plant families contained succulent species, followed by species (associated with photo and cultivation ideas) arranged by families. Done with _Adobe InDesign_ and _Adobe Illustrator_. Printed in Chiang Mai.

### Field Collections in Laos, Thailand, and Myanamar - QSBG, PTK
Help with field collections in Southern Laos (Boloven plateau), Southern Thailand (Krabi area), and Eastern Myanmar (Shan state), through collaborations of QSBG, PTK, Myanmar Herbarium, NP, and Kochi Botanic Garden. I have very little botanical knowledge, so I mainly helped with collection and pressing.

### Mangrove and _Spartina alterniflora_ in Fujian, China - ULB, CAS, IUE
For my MSc thesis, I aimed to study the effect of the invasive _S. alterniflora_ on mangrove structure and progression by comparing forest structure in sites that were previously covered by the cordgrass with sites that have never been invaded. I also set a field experiment to see if propagules settle at a slower rate in _Spartina_ marshes. _Data not published_

### Illustrations of mangroves trees characteristics for an illustrated identification key - ULB
As BSc final project, creation of illustrations of trees species characteristics (e.g. root type, leaf shape, fruit...) for an illustrated identification key to be used in the field by local people.
