## Past Projects

### Assessment of Google Earth Engine-based monitoring platform of sugarcane crops dynamics - University of Liège for a private company (Africa)
A simple GEE app was created to track intra-annual dynamics of various sugarcane plantations in an African country.


### How do EO products users identify and select EO products to work with - University of Liège for JRC
Several consultations were carried out between 2023 and 2024 to assess how EO product users identify and select the products they are working with.


### Permanent forest plots representativeness of typhoon-induced damages - NTNU
We assessed the representativeness of existing permanent forest plots for typhoon-induced canopy damages in Taiwan. Permanent plots may not be randomly located in the forest and may not accurately represent damages caused by typhoons (and therefore the forest dynamics).


### UAV-based typhoon disturbances detection - NTNU
Test of RGB UAV imagery to identify recent typhoon-induced disturbance on forests of northern Taiwan.


### Leaf wettability variation - NTNU
Assessment of leaf wettability variation across various species along a precipitation gradient in Taiwan.


### _Begonia_ unknown sp./hybrid study - AS 
Morphological and genetic study of an unknown _Begonia_ specimen, and comparison with two known species. It implied measurements (morphology, pollen count...), sequencing of nuclear and chloroplastic loci, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction (sequences of these three _Begonia_ and closely related species from Genbank).

### Educational boards for Palms garden - QSBG _unfinished_
Creation of educational boards for the Palms Garden with information relative to palm distribution, diversity, uses as well as interesting facts. Done with _Adobe InDesign_ and _Adobe Illustrator_.

### Succulent plant book of QSBG - QSBG
Plants labels may go missing, hence the production of an illustrated book of the succulent collection. I created this book based on previous and new identifications, as several plants lacked labels or were mislabelled. The book contains a brief introduction to the plant families containing succulent species, but the larger part of it is an illustrated list of all the succulent plant species (classed by families) in QSBG collection and their growth conditions. Done with _Adobe InDesign_ and _Adobe Illustrator_. Printed in Chiang Mai (500 copies).

### Field Collections in Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar - QSBG, PTK
I helped with field collections in Southern Laos (Boloven plateau), Southern Thailand (Krabi area), and Eastern Myanmar (Shan state), through collaborations of QSBG, PTK, Myanmar Herbarium, NP Singapore, and Kochi Botanic Garden. Due to my limited botanical knowledge, I mainly helped with collection and pressing.

### Mangrove and _Spartina alterniflora_ in Fujian, China - ULB, CAS, IUE
For my MSc thesis, I aimed to study the effect of the invasive _S. alterniflora_ on mangrove structure and progression by comparing forest structure in sites that were previously covered by the cordgrass with sites that have never been invaded. I also set a field experiment to see if propagules settled at a slower rate in _Spartina_ marshes (vs. mudflats and mangrove). _Data not published_

### Illustrations of mangroves trees characteristics for an illustrated identification key - ULB
As BSc final project, I participated in the creation of illustrations of mangrove trees species characteristics (e.g. root type, leaf shape, fruit...) for an illustrated identification key. World mangroves, as other wetlands, are endangered, thus the need for conservation teams to work with local to protect this precious ecotone.
