### Succulent plant greenhouse rearrangement - QSBG



### Succulent plant book - QSBG
Staff may mistake species from the succulent greenhouses or nursery, hence the production of an illustrated book of the succulent collection. I created this book based on previous and new identifications (wrong or missing labels in some case). The book contains a brief introduction of the plant families contained succulent species, followed by species (associated with photo and cultivation ideas) arranged by families. Done with _Adobe InDesign_ and _Adobe Illustrator_. Printed in Chiang Mai.

### Field Collections - QSBG, PTK
Help with field collections in Southern Laos (Boloven plateau), Southern Thailand (Krabi area), and Eastern Myanmar (Shan state), through collaborations of QSBG, PTK, Myanmar Herbarium, NP, and Kochi Botanic Garden. I have very little botanical knowledge, so I mainly helped with collection and pressing.
