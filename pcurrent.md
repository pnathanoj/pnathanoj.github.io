## Current projects

My current projects involve ecology, remote sensing, and agroecology to address questions related to ecosystem conservation, climate change, and socio-ecology.

### OBSYDYA: landscapes of Central and North Benin
The [OBSYDYA project](https://www.obsydya.org) focuses on the landscapes of Central and North Benin. It seeks to map these landscapes through yearly land cover maps that identify the various types of natural vegetation, crops, and built-up areas to track their dynamics and develop indicators related to agriculture, natural ecosystems, and pastoralism. OBSYDYA is a joint project of University of Parakou, INRAB (Benin), CIRAD, IRD (France), and the University of Li√®ge (Belgium). It is funded by the European Union.

### Sacred forests and forest conservation
Sacred forests are a type of sacred natural site that are characterized by their spiritual importance, and community protection and practices. Along with Masahiro Aiba (University of Tokyo) and Teng-Chiu Lin (National Taiwan Normal University), we studied the forest loss rate experienced by sacred forests of Japan in comparison with national protected forests. [The results have been published in Conservation Biology](https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.70093). Based on these findings, we are looking for other approaches to assess the local importance of sacred forests and their relation to green infrastructure.

### Earth Observation community and EO data producers
Because I have used several EO datasets with varying levels of processing in my studies, I am interested in exploring the relationships between EO product users and producers: how users identify products, how they choose one product over another, etc.


### Cyclones and socio-ecological and cultural systems
After exploring the effects of past cyclone exposure on cyclone-induced damages in Taiwan and across the world's mangroves, I am now assessing the relationships between cyclones and socio-ecological and cultural systems.
